### Plans

## Ideas

- Add attack speed(reaction) which based on DEX will decide who first and if diff between rolls x2(or failure) few attacks
- New Attribute (INT CONST) mb person stamina(const)
- 3 Attribute with 3 stats
- Add kinda Dodge(STR) and how combine with evasion?
- Think about classes? Warior and Rogue? mb will help with dodge/evasion
- Armor and weapons? (armor decrease incomming damage, weapon increase, mb durability of it)
- Think about range and movement(weapons with different range,)
- Special classes skills

## Tech Debt

- join configs in one file with different keys
- Move most of consts to properties
- Polish modules(replan what where should be)
- Refactor to not have stats and attrs in code (only configs)
